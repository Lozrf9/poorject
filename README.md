This is a rebooted repository for the purposes solely on the development and working of a card-based project(s).
Including HTML, CSS, SQL and databases necessary for the function of the programs and applications implemented into the entirety of the project.
Python, Java Script, and C# practices may be intermitten throughout as I find the most suitable components for the project as this has begun in a beginner stage and developing from a scratch premis.
Code, art, and sharing outlook and ETA of March 2026 - July 2026.
